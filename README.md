# Search-Based Software Engineering Course WS20/21

For now, the Jupyter notebooks are provided as is, and you will have to download and open them in Jupyter. Here's [how to install jupyter notebook on your machine](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).


## Chapter 1: Random and Local Search

The first chapter covers the coding examples from the first two weeks, on basic random search and local search algorithms.

## Chapter 2: Evolutionary Search (Part 1)

This chapter covers basic evolutionary strategies and genetic algorithms.

## Chapter 3: Evolutionary Search (Part 2)

This chapter looks at alternative search operators for genetic algorithms
and their consequences on diversity and fitness.

## Chapter 4: Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms

This chapter considers how to extend evolutionary search to more than one
objective function.

## Chapter 5: Search-Based Test Generation

This chapter looks at the basics of search-based test generation: How to
encode simple problems, what are fitness functions, and how can we adapt
search algorithms to work well on these problems.

## Chapter 6: Genetic Programming

This chapter introduces the basics of Genetic Programming, starting with
classical, untyped syntax tree, up to Grammatical Evolution.
